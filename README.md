# monophonic-flattening
Thesis Project centered around monophonic flattening on polyphonic drum patterns based on cognitive principles of human music perception. The way we achieve the flattening of these complex drum patterns considers factors such as density of the onsets by frequency group, strength of syncopation salience, and consideration of metrical pulse salience. 

Under the Music Technology Group in Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, for completion of Sound and Music Computing Master's.
